'''In Python, variables are used to store data values.
A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.    
Variables do not need to be declared with any particular type, and can even change type after they have been set.
We can assign a single value to multiple variables, or assign multiple values to multiple variables.'''

myInt = 5
myFloat = 5.5
myString = "Hello, World!"
myBool = True
myList = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
myTuple = (1, 2, 3)
myDict = {"key1": "value1", "key2": "value2"}
mySet = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
# above we have created variables of different types
# print(myInt)        # Output: 5
# print(myFloat)      # Output: 5.5
# print(myString)     # Output: Hello, World!NO
# print(myBool)       # Output: True
# print(myList)       # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
# print(myTuple)      # Output: (1, 2, 3)
# print(myDict)       # Output: {'key1': 'value1', 'key2': 'value2'}
# print(mySet)        # Output: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
# print("hello Ipad")  # Output: hello Ipad

print("Hi there we can use normal script like print , but instead of using + we use comma here ",myBool," see it worked")
